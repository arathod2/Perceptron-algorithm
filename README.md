Assignment 1 for module COMP527 to implement a Perceptron algorithm in Python.
-> Question 2: In this question i have implemented Binary Perceptron  Algorithm.
-> Question 3: In this question, binary perceptron is used to train classifiers to descriminate between:
			1) Class 1 and Class 2
			2) Class 2 and Class 3
			3) Class 3 and Class 1
-> Question 4: The binary perceptron is extended using one vs rest approach for multi-class classification. The training and testing accuracies are computed 	       		and compared for all the scenarios.Maximum number of iterations are 20.
-> Question 5: L2 regularisation is added to the multi-class classifier that is implemented in question 4 and trained accordingly. The accuracies are then 	       		calculated for different values of  regularisation coefficient.
